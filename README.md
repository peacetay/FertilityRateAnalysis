# FertilityRateAnalysis

The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on the key contributing factors and symptoms of a country with low fertility rate.
We will examine the relationship between each country’s indicators of development such as literacy rates, infant mortality, economic achievements, and fertility rate.</p>
<p>An interactive R Shiny app will be designed to see if the trade-off for achieving economic and societal successes, is an incapacitated fertility rate.
The application will help policy makers better understand how a country’s level of development can affect their fertility rate, and potentially provide guidance on the necessary actions to prevent a further decline in fertility rate.</p>
